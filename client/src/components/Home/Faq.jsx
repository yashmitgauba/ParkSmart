          question: "How does the parking allocation system work?",
          answer:
            "Our system uses advanced algorithms to optimize parking space allocation based on various factors including vehicle size, duration of stay, and special requirements. Users can reserve spaces through our app or website, and the system automatically assigns the most suitable spot.",

          question: "Can I integrate this with my existing building management system?",
          answer:
            "Yes! ParkSmart is designed with open APIs that allow seamless integration with most building management systems, access control systems, and payment platforms. Our technical team will work with you to ensure smooth integration.",
        },
        {
          question: "What hardware is required for implementation?",
          answer:
            "The basic system requires minimal hardware - just our smart controller unit and optional license plate recognition cameras. For advanced features like guided parking, additional sensors may be needed. We provide a complete assessment and recommendation based on your facility.",
        },
        {
          question: "How long does implementation typically take?",
          answer:
            "For standard parking facilities, implementation typically takes 2-4 weeks from initial assessment to full deployment. Larger or more complex facilities may require 6-8 weeks. Our team works efficiently to minimize disruption to your operations.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do you offer maintenance and support?",
          answer:
            "All our plans include 24/7 technical support. We also offer preventive maintenance packages to ensure your system runs optimally. Software updates are provided automatically at no additional cost.",
